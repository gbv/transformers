marcxml2mods.xsl is based on the official MODS Stylesheets from

http://www.loc.gov/standards/mods/mods-conversions.html

with local additions. Please check the official stylesheets and merge its
updates before adding more changes. New revisions are announced at the MODS
mailing list: 

http://listserv.loc.gov/listarch/mods.html

General additions may also become part of the official stylesheet, please
contact Tracy Meehleib <tmee@loc.gov> for requests.

The schemas/ directory contains MODS schemas for testing from

http://www.loc.gov/standards/mods/mods-schemas.html

The tests/ directory contains unit tests to be run with Apache ant. Running

    ant -lib lib test

will ensure that marcxml2mods.xsl is valid XSLT and creates valid MODS, at
least for the test cases. Additional tests require ant-contrib and Schematron 
for Apache Ant, which requires Saxon 9:

http://ant-contrib.sourceforge.net/
http://www.schematron.com/implementation.html
http://code.google.com/p/schematron/
http://saxon.sourceforge.net

Unfortunately I found no way to include the right saxon jar files in build.xml,
so you must point to them when calling ant.
